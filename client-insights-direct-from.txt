  Other: I am a 65-year-old retired Robotic Engineer (Alcoa Howmet) and a U.S. Veteran. In the community, I am known as Brother Brooklyn. I am the Founder and President of Mindset Education 501(c)(3) and InnerMan Education Mindset University.

My life’s work is the intersection of Neuroscience, STEM, and Faith—a field I call 'Neuro-Theology.' I’ve authored the book Lessons from the School of Hard Knocks to show how we can reprogram the brain to overcome struggle. My vision is to close the 'Neuro-Economic Gap' for 10 million youth worldwide. This website isn't just a portfolio; it's the engine for that mission."
